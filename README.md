## Description

This analysis report aims to determine the feasibility of establishing a real estate firm in the Baychester District of New York. To accomplish this, I utilized NYC Real Estate SQL data, along with tools such as R Studio, Power BI, and Advanced Excel. The report follows a comprehensive approach, beginning with descriptive analytics for data exploration, followed by predictive analytics using Time Series and Regression forecast models to predict future sales performance. Finally, prescriptive analytics utilizing Excel Solver is employed to assess the profitability of opening an office.<br>
Historical data shows residential sales in Baychester significantly surpass commercial sales: $120.7 million versus $29.76 million. Using a regression forecasting model, we projected residential sales for the next eight quarters (2022-2023), expecting approximately $1,093,024 in revenue. However, considering costs (initial investment, office space, labor, marketing), our estimated net present value of profit is around $430,000, with a 65% return on investment. Opening a Baychester office, focusing on residential sales, appears favorable. Practical aspects include limited manpower with only three employees and the need for in-depth risk analysis before making a final decision.<br>


## Objectives

💡 **Determine what type of realty to open**<br>
Choose between residential, commercial, mixed-use, or a combination of realty services based on the assigned neighborhood.<br>
💡 **Assess the market**<br>
Justify the business's capital requirements to lenders by highlighting the demand for services, expected growth, and the potential for profitable operations with satisfactory revenue levels.<br>
💡 **Strategic location**<br>
Minimize expenses and maximize efficiency by avoiding heavy competition and reducing travel time for agents. This ensures higher productivity, minimizes opportunity costs, prevents employee fatigue, saves on travel expenses, increases the frequency of closed sales, and establishes expertise in the chosen locale.<br>


## Report Findings
By delving into the results of the 2022 Toronto Building Assessment, we have extracted some fascinating insights into the state of building safety and compliance in specific regions. We made the following findings:
1. Building Safety Scores: The safety scores for private buildings, Toronto Community Housing Corporation buildings, and social housing providers are similar. However, the parking areas in all three building types have lower scores (below 3.5), requiring attention from law enforcement officers.

<br>

2. Evaluation Time Seasonalization: Evaluations tend to peak at the end of each year, possibly due to performance reviews for law enforcement officers. This concentration of evaluations within a short period may lead to less precise scores. It is recommended to distribute evaluations evenly throughout the year.

3. Geographic Distribution: Analyzing the latitude and longitude data reveals the distribution of buildings across different areas of Toronto. This information can assist tenants in making decisions based on the safety of neighborhoods.

These findings provide valuable insights into building safety and compliance in Toronto, enabling better decision-making for tenants and highlighting areas for improvement in evaluation processes.
